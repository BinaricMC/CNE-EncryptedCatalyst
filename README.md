# Encrypted Catalyst (Unfinished Build)
### Remnants of a Forgotten Time
If anyone reads this, then, hey there.

I'm sorry everything had to end this way, but we can't change it now.
This is what's left of Encrypted Catalyst as of writing this.
Enjoy.
Or don't, I can't stop you.

### So Why Release It Now?
The build was basically rotting away for months, so I decided to release it.
But, due to recent CNE changes + the mod being old/unfinished, there's likely A LOT of bugs.

So, if you find any bugs, pull request them to the repo and I'll add them.
Otherwise, I'll leave this repo alone forever.

### Why was it canned?
We would have finished this mod, but **a certain someone** decided to leave it dead.
To hell with him, and I hope you all enjoy what we did make so far.

Thank you for everything, and thank you for playing. (if you did play)

### But what if people want stuff removed?
I will remove as little as I can, but if I truly have to remove something, it'll be removed.
But nigh everything was made with EC in mind, so I doubt much will get recycled.

### Known Bugs / Issues
The video cutscene in Hamartia sometimes either won't play or is delayed.
    Workaround: Pausing and unpausing or restarting the song. It's only at the start, anyway.
    It's only at the start of the Finn week, lol

There is no background for Finn's week.
    This is intentional, as the artist asked for it to be removed.

### Contributor Notes
Don't make a mess; that's all.
